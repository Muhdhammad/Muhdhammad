### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Hammad, an aspiring machine-learning engineer and student based in Pakistan.

I love building models, experimenting with new ideas, and turning papers into code (that occasionally works).
Open to opportunities & collaborations. Feel free to connect!

**Fun fact:** I like reading fiction.
